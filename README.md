The MyToDo app does the thing that its name suggests. One can organise his/her tasks with MyToDo.
Steps to use:
  1: Import todo.sql from php myadmin.
  2: Run the ToDo2.php from localhost. (Make sure that the Todo1.jpeg and ToDo2.css are in same directory as that of ToDo2.php)
  3: You are good to go.
